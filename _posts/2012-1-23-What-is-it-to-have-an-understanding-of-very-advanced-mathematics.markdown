You can answer many seemingly difficult questions quickly.
----------------------------------------------------------

But you
  are not very impressed by what can look like magic, because you know
the trick. The trick is that your brain can quickly decide if question
is answerable by one of a few powerful general purpose “machines” (e.g.,
continuity arguments, the correspondences between geometric and
algebraic objects, linear algebra, ways to reduce the infinite to the
finite through various forms of compactness) combined with specific
facts you have learned about your area. The number of fundamental ideas
and techniques that people use to solve problems is, perhaps
surprisingly, pretty small — see
[http://www.tricki.org/tricki/map](//www.tricki.org/tricki/map)
for a partial list, maintained by Timothy Gowers.

You are often confident that something is true long before you have an airtight proof for it (this happens especially often in geometry).
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The main reason is that you have a large catalogue of connections
between concepts, and you can quickly intuit that if X were to be false,
that would create tensions with other things you know to be true, so you
are inclined to believe X is probably true to maintain the harmony of
the conceptual space. It’s not so much that you can imagine the
situation perfectly, but you can quickly imagine many other things that
are logically connected to it.

You are comfortable with feeling like you have no deep understanding of the problem you are studying.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Indeed, when you do have a deep understanding, you have solved the problem
and it is time to do something else. This makes the total time you spend in
life reveling in your mastery of something quite brief. One of the main
skills of research scientists of any type is knowing how to work comfortably
and productively in a state of confusion. More on this in the next few
bullets.

Your intuitive thinking about a problem is productive and usefully structured, wasting little time on being aimlessly puzzled.
--

For example, when answering a question about a high-dimensional space (e.g.,
whether a certain kind of rotation of a five-dimensional object has a “fixed
point” which does not move during the rotation), you do not spend much time
straining to visualize those things that do not have obvious analogues in two
and three dimensions. (Violating this principle is a huge source of frustration
for beginning maths students who don’t know that they shouldn’t be straining to
visualize things for which they don’t seem to have the visualizing machinery.)
Instead...

When trying to understand a new thing, you automatically focus on very simple examples that are easy to think about, and then you leverage intuition about the examples into more impressive insights.
--

For example, you might imagine two- and three-dimensional rotations that
are analogous to the one you really care about, and think about whether
they clearly do or don’t have the desired property. Then you think about
what was important to the examples and try to distill those ideas into
symbols. Often, you see that the key idea in the symbolic manipulations
doesn’t depend on anything about two or three dimensions, and you know
how to answer your hard question.As you get more mathematically
advanced, the examples you consider easy are actually complex insights
built up from many easier examples; the “simple case” you think about
now took you two years to become comfortable with. But at any given
stage, you do not strain to obtain a magical illumination about
something intractable; you work to reduce it to the things that feel
friendly.

The biggest misconception that non-mathematicians have about how mathematicians think is that there is some mysterious mental faculty that is used to crack a problem all at once.
--

In reality, one can ever think only a few moves ahead, trying out possible
attacks from one’s arsenal on simple examples relating to the problem, or
pushing at small parts of the big problem, or looking to make analogies with
other ideas one understands. This is the same way that one solves problems in
one’s first real maths courses in university and in competitions. What happens
as you get more advanced is simply that the arsenal grows larger, the thinking
gets somewhat faster due to practice, and you have more examples to try,
perhaps making better guesses about what is likely to yield progress.Indeed,
most of the bullet points here summarize feelings familiar to many serious
students of mathematics who are in the middle of their undergraduate careers;
as you learn more mathematics, these experiences apply to “bigger” things but
have the same fundamental flavor.

You go up in abstraction, “higher and higher”. The main object of study yesterday becomes just an example or a tiny part of what you are considering today.
--

For example, in calculus classes you think about functions or curves. In
functional analysis or algebraic geometry, you think of spaces whose points are
functions or curves — that is, you “zoom out” so that every function is just a
point in a space, surrounded by many other “nearby” functions. Using this kind
of zooming out technique, you can say very complex things in short sentences —
things that, if unpacked and said at the zoomed-in level, would take up pages.
Abstracting and compressing in this way allows you to consider extremely
complicated issues while using your limited memory and processing power.

The particularly “abstract” or “technical” parts of many other subjects seem quite accessible because they boil down to maths you already know.  You generally feel confident about your ability to learn most quantitative ideas and techniques.
--

A theoretical physicist friend likes to say, only partly in jest, that there
should be books titled “X for Mathematicians”, where X is something generally
believed to be difficult (quantum chemistry, general relativity, securities
pricing, formal epistemology). Those books would be short and pithy, because
many key concepts in those subjects are ones that mathematicians are well
equipped to understand. Often, those parts can be explained more briefly and
elegantly than they usually are if the explanation can assume a knowledge of
maths and a facility with abstraction.Learning the domain-specific elements of
a different field can still be hard — for instance, physical intuition and
economic intuition seem to rely on tricks of the brain that are not learned
through mathematical training alone. But the quantitative and logical
techniques you sharpen as a mathematician allow you to take many shortcuts that
make learning other fields easier, as long as you are willing to be humble and
modify those mathematical habits that are not useful in the new field.

You move easily between multiple seemingly very different ways of representing a problem.
--

For example, most problems and concepts have more algebraic representations
(closer in spirit to an algorithm) and more geometric ones (closer in spirit to
a picture). You go back and forth between them naturally, using whichever one
is more helpful at the moment.Indeed, some of the most powerful ideas in
mathematics (e.g., duality, Galois theory,  algebraic geometry) provide
"dictionaries" for moving between "worlds" in ways that, ex ante, are very
surprising.  For example, Galois theory allows us to use our understanding of
symmetries of shapes (e.g., rigid motions of an octagon) to understand why you
can solve any fourth-degree polynomial equation in closed form, but not any
fifth-degree polynomial equation. Once you know these threads between different
parts of the universe, you can use them like wormholes to extricate yourself
from a place where you would otherwise be stuck. The next two bullets expand on
this.

Spoiled by the power of your best tools, you tend to shy away from messy calculations or long, case-by-case arguments unless they are absolutely unavoidable.
--

Mathematicians develop a powerful attachment to elegance and depth, which are
in tension with, if not directly opposed to, mechanical calculation.
Mathematicians will often spend days thinking of a clean argument that
completely avoids numbers and strings of elementary deductions in favor of
seeing why what they want to show follows easily from some very deep and
general pattern that is already well-understood. Indeed, you tend to choose
problems motivated by how likely it is that there will be some "clean" insight
in them, as opposed to a detailed but ultimately unenlightening proof by
exhaustively enumerating a bunch of possibilities. (Nevertheless, detailed
calculation of an example is often an crucial part of beginning to see what is
really going on in a problem; and, depending on the field, somecalculation
often plays an essential role even in the best proof of a result.)In A
Mathematician's Apology
[https://www.math.ualberta.ca/~mss/misc/A%20Mathematician's%20Apology.pdf](link),
the most poetic book I know on what it is "like" to be a mathematician], G.H.
Hardy wrote:”In both these example theorems (and in the theorems, of course, I
include the proofs) there is a very high degree of unexpectedness, combined
with inevitability and economy. The arguments take so odd and surprising a
form; the weapons used seem so childishly simple when compared with the
far-reaching results; but there is no escape from the conclusions. There are no
complications of detail—one line of attack is enough in each case; and this is
true too of the proofs of many much more difficult theorems, the full
appreciation of which demands quite a high degree of technical proficiency. We
do not want many ‘variations’ in the proof of a mathematical theorem:
‘enumeration of cases’, indeed, is one of the duller forms of mathematical
argument. A mathematical proof should resemble a simple and clear-cut
constellation, not a scattered cluster in the Milky Way."A solution to a
difficult chess problem is quite genuine mathematics, and has its merits; but
it is just that 'proof by enumeration of cases' (and of cases which do not, at
bottom, differ at all profoundly) which a real mathematician tends to despise.


You develop a strong aesthetic preference for powerful and general ideas that connect hundreds of difficult questions, as opposed to resolutions of particular puzzles.
--

Mathematicians don’t really care about “the answer” to any particular question;
even the most sought-after theorems, like Fermat’s Last Theorem, are only
tantalizing because their difficulty tells us that we have to develop very good
tools and understand very new things to have a shot at proving them. It is what
we get in the process, and not the answer per se, that is the valuable thing.
The accomplishment a mathematician seeks is finding a new dictionary or
wormhole between different parts of the conceptual universe. As a result, many
mathematicians do not focus on deriving the practical or computational
implications of their studies (which can be a drawback of the hyper-abstract
approach!); instead, they simply want to find the most powerful and general
connections. Timothy Gowers has some interesting comments on this issue, and
disagreements within the mathematical community about it
[https://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/~wtg10/2cultures.pdf](link).

Understanding something abstract or proving that something is true becomes a task a lot like building something.
--

You think: “First I will lay this foundation, then I will build this framework
using these familiar pieces, but leave the walls to fill in later, then I will
test the beams…” All these steps have mathematical analogues, and structuring
things in a modular way allows you to spend several days thinking about
something you do not understand without feeling lost or frustrated. (I should
say, “without feeling unbearably lost and frustrated; some amount of these
feelings is inevitable, but the key is to reduce them to a tolerable
degree.)Andrew Wiles, who proved Fermat’s Last Theorem, used an “exploring”
metaphor: “Perhaps I can best describe my experience of doing mathematics in
terms of a journey through a dark unexplored mansion. You enter the first room
of the mansion and it’s completely dark. You stumble around bumping into the
furniture, but gradually you learn where each piece of furniture is.  Finally,
after six months or so, you find the light switch, you turn it on, and suddenly
it’s all illuminated. You can see exactly where you were. Then you move into
the next room and spend another six months in the dark. So each of these
breakthroughs, while sometimes they’re momentary, sometimes over a period of a
day or two, they are the culmination of—and couldn’t exist without—the many
months of stumbling around in the dark that proceed them.”

In listening to a seminar or while reading a paper, you don’t get stuck as much as you used to
--

You are good at modularizing a conceptual space, taking certain calculations or
arguments you don’t understand as “black boxes”, and considering their
implications anyway. You can sometimes make statements you know are true and
have good intuition for, without understanding all the details. You can often
detect where the delicate or interesting part of something is based on only a
very high-level explanation. (I first saw these phenomena highlighted by Ravi
Vakil, who offers insightful advice on being a mathematics student:
[http://math.stanford.edu/~vakil/potentialstudents.html](link).)

You are good at generating your own definitions and your own questions in thinking about some new kind of abstraction.
--

One of the things one learns fairly late in a typical mathematical education
(often only at the stage of starting to do research) is how to make good,
useful definitions. Something I’ve reliably heard from people who know parts of
mathematics well but never went on to be professional mathematicians (i.e.,
write articles about new mathematics for a living) is that they were good at
proving difficult propositions that were stated in a textbook exercise, but
would be lost if presented with a mathematical structure and asked to find and
prove some interesting facts about it. Concretely, the ability to do this
amounts to being good at making definitions and, using the newly defined
concepts, formulating precise conjectures that other mathematicians find
intriguing or enlightening.

This kind of challenge is like being given a world and asked to find
events in it that come together to form a good detective story. Unlike a
more standard detective, you have to figure out what the “crime”
(interesting question) might be; you’ll you have to generate your own
“clues” by building up deductively from the basic axioms. To do these
things, you use analogies with other detective stories (mathematical
theories) that you know and a taste for what is surprising or deep. How
this process works is perhaps the most difficult aspect of mathematical
work to describe precisely but also the thing that I would guess is the
strongest thing that mathematicians have in common.

You are easily annoyed by imprecision in talking about the quantitative or logical.
--

This is mostly because you are trained to quickly think about counterexamples
that make an imprecise claim seem obviously false.

On the other hand, you are very comfortable with intentional imprecision or “hand-waving” in areas you know, because you know how to fill in the details.
--

Terence Tao is very eloquent about this here [
http://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/there%E2%80%99s-more-to-mathematics-than-rigour-and-proofs/](link):
After learning to think rigorously, comes the 'post-rigorous' stage, in which
one has grown comfortable with all the rigorous foundations of one's chosen
field, and is now ready to revisit and refine one’s pre-rigorous intuition on
the subject, but this time with the intuition solidly buttressed by rigorous
theory. (For instance, in this stage one would be able to quickly and
accurately perform computations in vector calculus by using analogies with
scalar calculus, or informal and semi-rigorous use of infinitesimals, big-O
notation, and so forth, and be able to convert all such calculations into a
rigorous argument whenever required.) The emphasis is now on applications,
intuition, and the ‘big picture’. This stage usually occupies the late graduate
years and beyond.”In particular, an idea that took hours to understand
correctly the first time (“for any arbitrarily small epsilon I can find a small
delta so that this statement is true”) becomes such a basic element of your
later thinking that you don’t give it conscious thought.

Mathematicians are not immune to the limitations faced by most others.
--

They are not typically intellectual superheroes. For instance, they often
become resistant to new ideas and uncomfortable with ways of thinking (even
about mathematics) that are not their own. They can be defensive about
intellectual turf, dismissive of others, or petty in their disputes. Above, I
have tried to summarize how the mathematical way of thinking feels and works
at its best, without focusing on personality flaws of mathematicians or on
the politics of various mathematical fields. These issues are worthy of their
own long answers!

You are humble about your knowledge because you are aware of how weak maths is, and you are comfortable with the fact that you can say nothing intelligent about most problems.
--

There are only very few mathematical questions to which we have reasonably
insightful answers. There are even fewer questions, obviously, to which any
given mathematician can give a good answer. After two or three years of a
standard university curriculum, a good maths undergraduate can effortlessly
write down hundreds of mathematical questions to which the very best
mathematicians could not venture even a tentative answer. (The theoretical
computer scientist Richard Lipton lists some examples of potentially “deep”
ignorance here:
[https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2009/12/26/mathematical-embarrassments/](link))
This makes it more comfortable to be stumped by most problems; a sense that you
know roughly what questions are tractable and which are currently far beyond
our abilities is humbling, but also frees you from being very intimidated,
because you do know you are familiar with the most powerful apparatus we have
for dealing with these kinds of problems.
