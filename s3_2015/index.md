Life of a web request. How the Internet works?
----------------------------------------------

![Project image](internet_is_fascinating.jpg)

The Internet is becoming one of the most important tool that people use to
read, do and share research, messages and ideas. Many people use it as a tool
but not so many really understand how networks and the Internet works, evolve
and keep spreading its influence. The Internet is by itself a very vivid
subject of research related to the domain of distributed systems with very
active and open research mixing industry and academics. Making computers talk
to each others seems like obvious today but network protocols are the results
of a long process mixing engeering and scientific research.

The goal of this project would be to study, understand and recreate all the
protocols that make the Internet what it is.  We would study the Internet's
structure and protocols through experiments and dissecting network activity.
We'll use and write programs to explore what happens at a networking level as
you surf the Web, use a search engine, send emails, use torrents and more. All
these protocols would be tested and played with. At the end, students would be
able to craft a little Internet working within their own network.

Required material
------------------

- Curious students.
- Mostly PC running a recent UNIX system (GNU/Linux or MacOSX). For people
  running windows I can find workarounds.
- If you have some raspberry pi/Arduino available that would be great. Otherwise I will see if I can bring some with me.

Remy LEONE a PhD student working at Telecom Paris Tech in the field of
Wireless Sensors Networks. His research interests are passive monitoring of
networks, active estimation of energy reserve and lifetime expectancy of a
network. He studies technologies working at the edge of a constrained network
to help it live longer.

Student of S3++ in 2007 and member of [Paris Montagne](//paris-montagne.org)
since 2006. This association spreads science and taste of scientific research
in youngs and not so young minds.
