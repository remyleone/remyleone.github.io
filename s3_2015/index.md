title: S3 2015 proposal
description: How the Internet works.
---

Abstract
--------

The goal of this project would be to recreate all the protocols that make the
Internet what it is.  We would study the Internet's structure and protocols
through fun experiments from the Python perspective. We'll use Python
libraries to explore what happens at a networking level as you surf the Web,
use a search engine, send emails and more.

In summary we would study the protocols by order:

- How does mail work? How does Spamming works? How can we fight back?
- How does chatting works on the Internet? What are the different pattern for distributed systems?
- How does the web work? What is a web-cache?
- How does Google works? How can we build a search engine?
- How does big websites works? What is scaling?
- How does naming work on the Internet? Why does 8.8.8.8 means for liberty in Turkey or in other country?
- How does torrent works? Why is this method for sharing file very efficient? Is it used for something
else than sharing illegal content?
- What is the Internet of tomorrow? What is Internet of Things?

All these protocols would be tested and played with. Ideally we would even
craft a little Internet working within our own network.

Required material
------------------

- Curious students.
- Mostly PC running a recent UNIX system (GNU/Linux or MacOSX). For people
  running windows I can find workarounds.
- If you have some raspberry pi/Arduino available that would be great. Otherwise I will see if I can bring some with me.

#TODO My main interests are related to the Internet of Things, network
protocols and energy savings.  If you want to know more about my PhD
[http://sieben.fr/phd](http://www.sieben.fr/phd). Tell me what you think about
it or if it's still shady.
