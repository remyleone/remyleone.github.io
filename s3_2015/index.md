Project proposal
----------------

The goal of this project would be to recreate all the protocols that make the Internet
what it is. 

In summary we would study the protocols by order:

- How does mail work? How does Spamming works (Simulate a Bayseian filter)? 
- How does chatting works on the Internet? What are the different pattern for distributed systems?
- How does the web work? What is a web-cache?
- How does google works? How can we build a search engine?
- How does big websites works? What is scaling?
- How does naming work on the Internet? Why does 8.8.8.8 means for liberty in Turkey or in other country?
- How does torrent works? Why is this method for sharing file very efficient? Is it used for something
else than sharing illegal content?
- What is the Internet of tomorrow? What is Internet of Things?

All this protocols would be tested and implemented. Ideally I would like to
recreate a little Internet working within our own network.

Requiered material
------------------

- Curious students.
- Mostly PC running a recent UNIX system (GNU/Linux or MacOSX). For people
  running windows I can find workarounds.
- If you have some raspberry pi/Arduino available that would be great. Other
  wise I will see if I can bring some with me.
