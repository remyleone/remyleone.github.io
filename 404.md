The Heaviest Burden.
====================

>What if a demon crept after you into your loneliest loneliness some day or
>night, and said to you: "This life, as you live it at present, and have lived
>it, you must live it once more, and also innumerable times; and there will be
>nothing new in it, but every pain and every joy and every thought and every
>sigh, and all the unspeakably small and great in thy life must come to you
>again, and all in the same series and sequence - and similarly this spider and
>this moonlight among the trees, and similarly this moment, and I myself. The
>eternal sand-glass of existence will ever be turned once more, and you with it,
>you speck of dust!" - Would you not throw yourself down and gnash your teeth,
>and curse the demon that so spoke? Or have you once experienced a tremendous
>moment in which you would answer him: "You are a God, and never did I hear
>anything so divine!" If that thought acquired power over you as you are, it
>would transform you, and perhaps crush you; the question with regard to all and
>everything: "Do you want this once more, and also for innumerable times?" would
>lie as the heaviest burden upon your activity! Or, how would you have to become
>favourably inclined to yourself and to life, so as to long for nothing more
>ardently than for this last eternal sanctioning and sealing?
