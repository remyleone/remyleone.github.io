Every line of the code and articles that make this website what it is
was written using [vim](http://www.vim.org/). The article are written
using Markdown as file format. This website use
[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) to generate static content and is hosted
thanks to [github](http://github.com).

I currently use [Ubuntu](http://ubuntu.com) as operating system on my Dell
E6230 and I'm quite happy about it.
