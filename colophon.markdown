description: List of tools that Remy Leone use to get stuff done.
---

Sometimes people ask me what are the tools that use and I've gather quite
a lot of useful website and links.

So I'm going to gather it all here as an [usesthis](//usesthis.com) article.

What hardware do I use?
-----------------------

I really like lenovo and Dell computers. So far I'm very happy with the
computers that my work provides. A Dell E6230 is the machine I use all day
long. I strongly recommend it as it is shipped with an ubuntu as operating
system.

What software do I use?
-----------------------

I will add here through different sections all my tools. Most of them are
pretty standards but I've noticed that fellow PhD students that don't have
software engineering as a background usually lack some knowledge about
efficient tools to get the job done.

### Editing

I code mainly using [vim](//www.vim.org) boosted with a set of plugins
[http://vim.spf13.com/](//vim.spf13.com/) and IntelliJ

### Code tools

#### All languages tools

- [git](//git-scm.com) If you don't know it yet check it out it's really a
  well-known tool to manage changes in a set of files.
- [zsh](//zsh.sourceforge.net) check also the
  [oh-my-zsh](//github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) framework. Truly
  excellent to create a very efficient shell usage.

#### C programming

- [clang](//clang.llvm.org/) Provide very useful warning messages. This tool also provides
an excellent analyzer [http://clang-analyzer.llvm.org/](//clang-analyzer.llvm.org/).

- [valgrind](//valgrind.org) Very useful to test for memory leaks.

#### Python programming

Follow this guide
[http://docs.python-guide.org/](//docs.python-guide.org/) and check out
the tools it reference.

### Website

It's not precisely software but these tools come handy.

- [getpocket](//getpocket.com) I store all the pages I want to read on this website.
  This website renders it well on every platforms. Got several thoushands of
  articles stored over there. Very useful.
- [github](//github.com) If you are new to code and to git check out
  [this](//try.github.io).
- [quora](//quora.com) A lot of very content is on this question/answer
  website. Check it out.
- [splitwise](//splitwise.com) I use this website to keep track of the money
  that I owe to people. Very handy.

### Google

I use heavily google products. Many people got a google account but very few of
them know how to get the most out of it. I strongly recommend for anyone that
use gmail a lot to follow the following
[tutorial](//www.gmail.com/intl/fr/mail/help/tips.html). The most useful
of these tips is keyboard shortcuts that can really heavily speed up the
operation you do in gmail.
