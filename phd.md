title: RÃ©my, what's your PhD about?
description: A little story to explain what my PhD is about
---

Well, that's an interesting question. Through time I've found a couple of
tricks to explain what I do. This text will be a summary of it.

Let's introduce a story:

Imagine that you have a park in which a network of sleepy workers live. The main reason why the workers
sleep all the time is that they have to save up as much energy as possible.
Once they run out of energy they die. These workers work in their environment and
connect to each other to send information to the rest of the world.

A lot of people on the outside of this little world want to know what happen
inside. They could ask to the worker directly how they are doing and what they
have been up to but it would force the worker to staying up an answer to
everybody. They will use energy repeating all the time the same things
over and over again to various people.

I want to save this worker and make their little network work as long as
possible. To do that I'm building up a guardian at the entrance of the park.
This guardian will be the only one talking with the worker. Because the
guardian is strong it can intercept all the questions from the outside world
and answer them quickly.

An other interesting point is that the guardian knows a lot about the little
worker even without asking them directly (The worker use energy to answer any
question). The guardian knows how much each word that a worker say cost him.
Therefore, by remembering how many words the worker said he can deduce
how much words the worker still have before dying.

But sometimes the worker whisper so quietly that even the guardian cannot hear
it. Sometimes the words are lost. Sometimes the guardian have to ask directly
and set the record straight. I design tricks for the guardian to analyze as
much as possible what is going on by simply observing and being smart.

Now replace these little workers by little computers that will probably spread
in the next decades our world and you have a quick view on why I care.
